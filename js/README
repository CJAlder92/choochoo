this is largely based on
https://itnext.io/a-template-for-creating-a-full-stack-web-application-with-flask-npm-webpack-and-reactjs-be2294b111bd

the code in src is compiled into bundle.js by 'npm run dev-build' and
then served by flask.

that file (bundle.js) will need to be included in binary
distributions.
