  * XXX  Format times and distances better.

* XXX  StatisticRanking data on monitor stats

* XXX (medians)  What are max/min HR floats in activity summary?

* Simplified config and startup instructions

* Block multiple default-config (currently multiplies entries!)

* Set tz at start so we don't delete data on first diary

* XXX  Why is deleting intervals so slow?  Missing index?
