A training diary written mainly for myself, but perhaps attractive to others
who also want a way to track and plan their progress that is open, lightweight
and extensible.

The main interface is a curses-style diary, used to track daily activity
as well as progress towards aims.  A flexible "schedule spec" is used to
define periodic events (eg training routines) and (unfortunately) there's 
dedicated fuctionality for tracking injuries.

In the future there will be support for plotting data as well as better
integration of FIT format files (which already have a rudimentary parser).
One omission that may be important to some people is tha (purposeful)
lack of emphasis on power meters.
