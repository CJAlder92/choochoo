# Choo-Choo

This is a training diary built around my own needs as an (injured)
cyclist.

Currently it focusses on tracking and managing injuries.

## Getting Started

This is very basic, still in development, could break at any point,
and was written to scratch a personal itch rather than be a general
tool.  So I don't promise much.  But if you want to try anyway you
would need to do something like:

* Clone this repo

* Run the dev/make-env.sh script to set the Python environment

* Enable the environment with `source env/bin/activate`

* Start the program with `dev/ch2 diary` (also `aims`, `injuries` and
  `reminders`).

It's developed on Linux but with a little care should be
cross-platform.
