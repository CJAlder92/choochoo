# Segments

If we are going to fit parameters in the [FF-Model](impulse.md) we
need multiple, consistent measurements.  One way of doing this is to
repeatedly ride a selected route at threshold pace.  Over time our
performance should change.

This motivates *segments* in Choochoo.  They automatically detect the
ride and generate the required statistic(s).
