## Introduction

Choochoo's data (*your* data) are stored in an SQLite3 file at 
`~/.ch2/database.sqlc` (the final character may change with database
schema version).  If you want direct access, you can use any programming
language with an SQLite binding.

But this documentation focuses on simpler, more direct (but also more
limited) access via [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and 
[Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) - this will let you read, manipulate and
plot data within your web browser.
