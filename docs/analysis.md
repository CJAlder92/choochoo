## Introduction

This documentation focuses on simple, direct (but also limited) data access 
via [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) - 
this will let you read, manipulate and plot data within your web browser.

Choochoo's data (*your* data) are stored in an SQLite3 file at 
`~/.ch2/database.sqlc` (the final character may change with database
schema version).  So you can also use any programming language with an 
SQLite binding.
